Hello 
We are Team Triangle, The topic we choose was data science. and the subtopic we chose was Video summarization. So, the given question was -

 “Build the video summarization model to extract a summary of a video. Summarized video content helps us to understand the video content without watching a video. Use summarised text to build a video search engine, which will help to search a video just by the video’s description.” 

and we are very new to coding and we knew our approach from the very beginning. The problem was due to our under skilled coding and lack of other coding knowledges, we got stuck at many places. We faced a lot of errors and dead ends but we somehow managed to rectify most of the errors but a few of them are still out there and its causing so many other errors in code.  The biggest problem which we faced was we couldn’t integrate the code files together to the webpage. 
We hope you understand what we are trying to communicate and we actually came to experience the tech-a-thon as this is our first time. we’d also like to thank tech-stack and ineuron for providing this great opportunity. 

Now we’d like to explain what we have achieved or how much we have progressed in our project. So, we could successfully summarize a given youtube video via youtube api and we used a machine learning pipeline named en_core_web_lg to process and analysis the video transcription and then it  converts to summary. It summaries on the basis of word frequencies. It chunks out the sentences from the given transcription and converts it to summary. 

And the video engine, we’ll enter a keyword and if a given exist in the video meta data then it’ll print out the video descriptions and title . We used HTML session and beautify session module to extract the YouTube data. If the keyword exists in all the video meta data we provided then it’ll successfully run.
 
We tried to achieve a glossy finish in the webpage session by applying glow affect which adds a bit more aestheticness to our project presentation  . We used some JavaScript  functions and Jquery  for the  search bar and the animation which makes the page more interactive  . The “Most relavant video” section was supposed to bring the search results of the text -video engine and for some reason we couldn’t achieve this properly  . 



Thank you
